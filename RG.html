		series of the 1:144 Gunpla line. These kits feature extensive detail 
		and articulation, as well as a poseable skeletal frame comparable to 
		the 1:100 Master Grade kits. The first RG kit was the 1:144 RX-78-2 
		Gundam, followed by the 1:144 MS-06S Char's Zaku II, GAT-X105 Aile 
		Strike,[5] MS-06F Zaku II (Green), ZGMF-X10A Freedom. In 2011, Bandai 
		released the Entry Grade (EG) line in Southeast Asia. Manufactured in 
		China, the EG line contained fewer parts than the FG kits, thus having 
		very limited articulation. Only four Gundams were released in the line.</p>

		<h1> HG(High Grade) </h1>

		<p>HG is 1:144, about 13cm, with good shape and medium joints. 
		There are not many parts, the box is small, more popular, suitable 
		for novices, a few parts of HG have a streamlined skeleton, most
		 hollow.</p>
		<p>The very first kits have been running for 30 years (starting 
		with RX-78-2 Gundam) and are routinely re-released by Bandai. As 
		these kits are limited in articulation and require glue (for the 
		early kits) and paint to assemble, these have retroactively been 
		categorized as No Grade (NG), to differentiate them from First 
		Grade (FG).</p>

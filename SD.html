		<h1> SD </h1>
		<p>SD Gundam is a media franchise that spawned from the Gundam franchise. 
		SD Gundam takes the mecha from Gundam and expresses them in super deformed 
		and anthropomorphic style.</p>
		<p>SD Gundam originated from a contributed illustration of a junior student 
		from Nagoya by the name of Koji Yokoi to the "Model News" magazine that 
		Bandai was issuing in the 1980s. The illustration is of a Gundam but with 
		an unusual proportion where the overall height of the Gundam is equal to 
		twice that of its head.</p>

		<p class="d">Gunpla (ガンプラ Ganpura), a portmanteau of "Gundam plastic model", 
		is the common name for plastic model kits depicting the vehicles and 
		characters of the fictional Gundam universe by Bandai. These kits have 
		become popular among mecha anime fans and model enthusiasts in Japan 
		and in other nearby Asian countries since the 1980s. Gundam modeling 
		spread in the 1990s with North America and Europe being exposed to 
		Gundam through television, video and manga.</p>

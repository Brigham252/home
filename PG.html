		<h1> PG(Perfect Grade) </h1>
		<p>The PG is 1:60, 30cm or so, the fineness is high, the details of the engraved lines are many, and the movable joints are flexible. But the price is expensive, the parts are the most, and there is a perfect skeleton internal structure.</p>
		<p>Perfect Grade (PG) is the ultimate line in Bandai kits. Originating in 1997 with the EVA-01 PG kit from Evangelion. The first PG Gunpla kit was a RX 78-2 Gundam model that was released in 1998. Only 18 kits have been released as 1/60 Perfect Grade since then. As the name suggests Perfect Grade gunpla kits attempt to represent the Gundam as perfectly as possible with real world limitations. These limitations force the Perfect Grade line to sometimes take several years between releases as new technologies in model making are sometimes required to recreate these effects. Features like metal joints, increased detail in plastic molding and plastic quality, as well as gimmicks like LED kits are signatures of the PG line. With flamboyance comes cost however and most of these kits are well above the average price for a gunpla model. Though the target age is 15 and up these kits should usually only be built by experienced builders as their increased detail does lead to some challenges during the build. [8]</p>

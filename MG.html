		<h1> MG(Master Grade) </h1>

		<p>The MG is 1:100, with a fine appearance and reasonable joints. 
		There are more parts, and the details of the engraved lines are 
		more than RG. Most of the later models have complete skeleton 
		internal structures.</p>
		<p>Master Grade (MG) models were first introduced in the summer 
		of 1995, designed and made to higher standards than most other 
		models. These kits take much longer to construct and are often 
		much more expensive than their lower-grade counterparts.[6] More 
		recent Master Grade plastic models typically feature a movable 
		inner frame system which enables extensive movement and bending 
		of joints. As well including standing and seating miniature 
		figures of the pilots of each gundam model. The popularity of 
		this line was so great that a lot of old and new mobile suits 
		from non-graded series were remade as Master Grade models.</p>
